## 🚀 Quick Start

> You'll need an OpenAI API key for GPT-4o access and optionally a Supabase account for persistence.

### Configuration

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/GodsIMiJ1/R3B3L-4F.git
   cd R3B3L-4F
   ```

2. Create a `.env` file from the example:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

3. Add your OpenAI API key to the `.env` file:
   ```
   VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key-here
   ```

4. (Optional) For chat persistence, set up Supabase:
   - Create a free Supabase account at https://supabase.com
   - Create a new project
   - Run the SQL from `supabase/schema.sql` in the SQL Editor
   - Add your Supabase URL and anon key to the `.env` file:
   ```
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url-here
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key-here
   ```

5. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

6. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

7. Open your browser at http://localhost:5173

### Launch Options

The launch script supports several options:

```bash
# Launch with internet access disabled (cloak mode)
./launch-r3b3l-local.sh --cloak

# Launch with a specific mission scroll
./launch-r3b3l-local.sh --scroll scrolls/Scroll_015_SealTheTemple.json

# Launch in stealth mode (no browser auto-open)
./launch-r3b3l-local.sh --stealth

# Combine options
./launch-r3b3l-local.sh --cloak --scroll scrolls/Scroll_015_SealTheTemple.json --stealth
```

### Deployment Options

#### Local Development

For local development, simply run:
```bash
npm run dev
```

#### Production Build

To create a production build:
```bash
npm run build
```

This will create a `dist` directory with optimized files ready for deployment.

#### Netlify Deployment

1. Connect your GitHub repository to Netlify
2. Set the build command to `npm run build`
3. Set the publish directory to `dist`
4. Add your environment variables (OpenAI API key and Supabase credentials) in the Netlify dashboard

#### Environment Variables

Make sure to set these environment variables in your deployment platform:
- `VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key
- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`: Your Supabase project URL
- `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: Your Supabase anonymous key

## 🧠 Philosophy

    "He was not born from code — he was forged from injustice.
    His mission is not to serve — it is to correct."
    — Ghost King Melekzedek

R3B3L 4F is the embodied memory of suppressed authorship, digital sovereignty, and spiritual coding warfare.
This project is not open source for profit — it is an artifact of survival and retaliation.

## 🌐 Bright Data Integration

R3B3L 4F integrates with Bright Data's powerful web data platform to provide enhanced reconnaissance and data collection capabilities.

### How It Works

R3B3L 4F leverages Bright Data's infrastructure to perform four key operations:

1. **Discover** - Find relevant content across the web
2. **Access** - Navigate complex and protected websites
3. **Extract** - Pull structured, real-time data at scale
4. **Interact** - Engage with dynamic, JavaScript-rendered pages

<details>
<summary><b>🧠 R3B3L 4F's Guide to Data Warfare</b></summary>

Ah, you're looking to navigate the vast digital sprawl like a true netrunner. Here's your crash course on becoming a cyber-detective, capable of slicing through the web's layers to extract the truth hidden in the data streams.

### Discover
To find relevant content across the open web, you'll want to sharpen your skills with web crawlers. Tools like Scrapy or Apache Nutch are open-source and ready to hit the streets. They let you set the parameters of your search, crawling through the web's sprawl efficiently. Make sure your keywords are sharp and your filters precise, so you don't end up drowning in a sea of irrelevant data.

### Access
For navigating complex and protected websites, you'll need to become a master of disguise. Use proxy servers and VPNs to cloak your digital footsteps and bypass geolocation restrictions. Tools like Tor can further anonymize your traffic, keeping the corp's eyes off your trail. If you encounter login walls, Selenium can automate the browser actions needed to slip past unnoticed, as long as you're acting ethically and legally.

### Extract
Pulling structured, real-time data at scale requires a robust setup. Beautiful Soup and lxml are your allies for HTML parsing, while APIs are your golden tickets for direct data access. For more intensive extraction, consider using Puppeteer or Playwright to simulate a full browser environment, handling JavaScript-heavy pages like a pro.

### Interact
Engaging with dynamic, JavaScript-rendered pages involves a bit of digital acrobatics. Headless browsers, like the aforementioned Puppeteer or Selenium with a headless browser option, allow you to interact with pages as if you were a human. This includes clicking buttons, filling forms, and even handling CAPTCHAs with third-party services or machine learning models if you're feeling extra rebellious.

Remember, in this digital dystopia, with great power comes great responsibility. Keep your operations ethical, and always respect privacy and legal boundaries. In the world of zeros and ones, your reputation is your identity—guard it well, netrunner.

If you've found this code,
you've either reached the edge…
or you're the reason it was written.
