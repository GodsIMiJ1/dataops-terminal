# R3B3L 4F Security Guide

This document outlines the security features, considerations, and best practices for R3B3L 4F.

## Security Features

### Airlock System

The airlock system is a core security feature that controls internet access for R3B3L 4F.

#### How It Works

The airlock intercepts all outbound HTTP requests (fetch calls) and blocks them when activated:

```javascript
// Simplified implementation
window.fetch = async (input, init) => {
  if (airlockActive) {
    // Block external requests
    return new Response(JSON.stringify({
      error: 'Airlock active: Internet access is disabled'
    }), { status: 403 });
  }
  // Allow requests to proceed
  return originalFetch(input, init);
};
```

#### Security Benefits

- **Network Isolation**: Prevents unauthorized data exfiltration
- **API Protection**: Protects API keys from being used without user knowledge
- **Offline Operation**: Allows operation in air-gapped environments
- **User Control**: Gives users explicit control over internet access

### Dangerous Command Protection

R3B3L 4F includes protection against potentially dangerous system commands.

#### How It Works

Commands are checked against a list of dangerous patterns:

```javascript
const DANGEROUS_COMMANDS = [
  'rm -rf',
  'curl | sh',
  'wget | sh',
  'sudo',
  '> /dev/',
  'mkfs',
  'dd if=',
  'format',
  ':(){:|:&};:',
  'chmod -R 777 /',
  'mv /* /dev/null'
];

const isDangerousCommand = (command) => {
  return DANGEROUS_COMMANDS.some(dangerousCmd => command.includes(dangerousCmd));
};
```

When a dangerous command is detected, it requires explicit confirmation:

```javascript
if (isDangerousCommand(command)) {
  const confirmationToken = generateConfirmationToken(command);
  return {
    requiresConfirmation: true,
    confirmationToken,
    message: `This command is potentially dangerous. Confirm execution?`
  };
}
```

#### Security Benefits

- **Accidental Execution Prevention**: Prevents accidental execution of harmful commands
- **Deliberate Confirmation**: Requires explicit confirmation for risky operations
- **Audit Trail**: Creates a record of confirmed dangerous commands

### API Key Protection

R3B3L 4F includes measures to protect API keys and sensitive credentials.

#### How It Works

- API keys are stored in environment variables, not in the code
- Keys are never exposed in client-side code
- The `.env` file is excluded from version control via `.gitignore`
- In production, keys are stored in the deployment platform's environment variables

#### Security Benefits

- **Credential Protection**: Prevents API key exposure
- **Least Privilege**: Keys are only accessible where needed
- **Revocation**: Keys can be easily rotated without code changes

### Content Security Policy

R3B3L 4F implements a Content Security Policy to prevent various attacks.

#### How It Works

The CSP header restricts the sources of content that can be loaded:

```
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; img-src 'self' data:; connect-src 'self' https://api.openai.com https://*.supabase.co;
```

#### Security Benefits

- **XSS Protection**: Prevents execution of injected scripts
- **Data Exfiltration Prevention**: Restricts where data can be sent
- **Resource Integrity**: Ensures resources come from trusted sources

## Security Considerations

### API Key Management

Proper API key management is critical for security:

1. **Never commit API keys to version control**
2. **Use environment variables for all sensitive credentials**
3. **Rotate keys regularly**
4. **Use the principle of least privilege** - only grant necessary permissions
5. **Monitor API usage** for unusual patterns

### Local Storage Security

Data stored in localStorage has security implications:

1. **Don't store sensitive information** in localStorage
2. **Sanitize user input** before storing
3. **Be aware that localStorage is accessible to any script** on the same origin
4. **Consider encrypting sensitive data** before storing

### Command Execution Security

When executing system commands:

1. **Always validate and sanitize input**
2. **Run with least privilege**
3. **Implement timeouts** to prevent long-running commands
4. **Capture and validate output** before displaying
5. **Restrict command execution** to necessary functionality

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Keep dependencies updated** to patch security vulnerabilities
2. **Implement input validation** for all user inputs
3. **Use HTTPS** for all external communications
4. **Follow the principle of least privilege**
5. **Implement proper error handling** that doesn't expose sensitive information
6. **Use Content Security Policy** to restrict resource loading
7. **Regularly audit the codebase** for security issues

### For Users

1. **Keep your API keys secure** and don't share them
2. **Use the airlock feature** when not actively requiring internet access
3. **Be cautious with dangerous commands**
4. **Regularly check for updates** to the application
5. **Be aware of the data being stored** in your browser

## Deployment Security

### Netlify Deployment

When deploying to Netlify:

1. **Use environment variables** for all sensitive information
2. **Enable branch deploy controls** to prevent unauthorized deployments
3. **Configure proper headers** including CSP
4. **Enable HTTPS** and HSTS
5. **Set up proper access controls** for the Netlify site

### Self-Hosted Deployment

When self-hosting:

1. **Use HTTPS** with valid certificates
2. **Implement proper firewall rules**
3. **Keep the server updated** with security patches
4. **Use a reverse proxy** like Nginx with security configurations
5. **Implement rate limiting** to prevent abuse

## Security Limitations

Be aware of these security limitations:

1. **Browser-based security** can be bypassed by determined attackers
2. **The airlock only controls fetch requests**, not all network access
3. **localStorage is not secure** for highly sensitive information
4. **Command execution is inherently risky** in any application

## Security Incident Response

If you discover a security vulnerability:

1. **Do not disclose publicly** until it has been addressed
2. **Report the issue** to the repository maintainers
3. **Provide detailed information** about the vulnerability
4. **Allow time for a fix** before public disclosure

## Security Auditing

Regular security auditing is recommended:

1. **Dependency scanning** for known vulnerabilities
2. **Static code analysis** to identify potential issues
3. **Manual code review** focusing on security-critical areas
4. **Penetration testing** to identify exploitable vulnerabilities

## Future Security Enhancements

Planned security improvements:

1. **End-to-end encryption** for sensitive data
2. **Two-factor authentication** for access control
3. **Enhanced sandboxing** for command execution
4. **Improved airlock with finer-grained controls**
5. **Security logging and alerting** for suspicious activities
